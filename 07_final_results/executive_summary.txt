Generated: 2026-02-09 10:24:00

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
• Developed and compared GLM and XGBoost models for binary classification
• Dataset: 50,000 records with 18 features
• Target: Imbalanced binary outcome (68% class 0, 32% class 1)

KEY RESULTS:
• WINNING MODEL: XGBoost
• Test Set Performance:
  - Accuracy: 0.739
  - Precision: 0.566
  - Recall: 0.788
  - F1-Score: 0.659
  - AUC-ROC: 0.829

BUSINESS IMPACT:
• Model provides reliable predictions for business decision-making
• High precision reduces false positive costs
• Balanced recall ensures minimal missed opportunities
• Interpretable results support regulatory compliance

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
• Comprehensive feature engineering created 30 features
• Multiple class imbalance handling strategies implemented
• Rigorous cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization
