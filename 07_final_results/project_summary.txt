✓ Final Documentation & Compliance (07_final_results/)

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
• Developed robust binary classification models using GLM and XGBoost
• Implemented comprehensive feature engineering pipeline
• Applied advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques
• Conducted statistical significance testing for model selection
• Provided local interpretability analysis using LIME
• Ensured compliance with modeling governance guidelines

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
• Dataset: 50,000 records, 18 features + target
• Problem Type: Binary classification (imbalanced)
• Models: Logistic Regression (L1/L2/Elastic Net) vs XGBoost
• Evaluation: Rigorous cross-validation and holdout testing
• Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC

NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
